Cloudflare Workers allow you to add logic to your site that runs on Cloudflare's edge servers, making it extremely fast. LaunchDarkly's Cloudflare Worker integration ensures that all of your LaunchDarkly flags are synced with the key-value store available to Workers. This means that you can perform logic at the edge dependent of flags as well as provide an instant cache of client-side flag values.
